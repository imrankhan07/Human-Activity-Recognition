# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human activity recognition, or HAR for short, is a broad field of study concerned with identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data.  Movements are often typical activities performed indoors, such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting. They may also be more focused activities such as those types of activities performed in a kitchen or on a factory floor.  The sensor data may be remotely recorded, such as video, radar, or other wireless methods. Alternately, data may be recorded directly on the subject such as by carrying custom hardware or smart phones that have accelerometers and gyroscopes.
